  <h2 class="definition-heading">Definitions</h2>

  <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="independent-variable-definition">Independent Variable</h3>
    <p>The variable that is intentionally manipulated or changed by the researcher in an experiment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="dependent-variable-definition">Dependent Variable</h3>
    <p>The variable that is measured or observed in an experiment and is expected to change as a result of the independent variable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="population-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>Everyone who could possibly be a participant in the study.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="sample-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>A smaller set of data that a researcher chooses or selects from a larger population using a pre-defined selection method.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="experimental-group-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>The group of participants in an experiment who are exposed to the independent variable(can take the form of a treatment or intervention).</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="control-group-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>The group of participants in an experiment who do not receive the independent variable (can take the form of a treatment or intervention). They are used as a comparison group to assess the effects of the treatment.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="p-value-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>A measure of the statistical significance of the results in a hypothesis test. It indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="statistical-significance-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>n indication that the results of a statistical analysis are unlikely to occur by chance. It suggests that the observed findings are likely to be a true effect rather than a result of random variation.</p>
  </div>


  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>Selective Attention - the processes that allow an individual to select and focus on particular stimuli for further processing while simultaneously suppressing distracting information.</p>

  <p>If a group of high school students are given a set of colored words that are the same colors as the word, then students will on average say the words 30% faster when compared to a group that says words that arenâ€™t the same color.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Explain the methodology and procedures used in your analysis or experiment.</p>
