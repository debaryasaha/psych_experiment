  <h2 id="independent-variable">Independent Variable</h2>
  <p>The <a href="#independent-variable">Independent Variable</a> was the type of test given to the participants. One test had the colors matching the words, while the others had mismatched colors and words. For example, the word green would be colored purple.</p>

  <h2 id="dependent-variable">Dependent Variable</h2>
  <p>The <a href="#dependent-variable">Dependent Variable</a> is the time it takes for the participant to complete the test. The number of mistakes was also counted.</p>

  <h2 id="population">Population</h2>
  <p>The <a href="#population">Population</a> was all students in Metea Valley High School grades 9 - 12.</p>

   <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>Selective Attention - the processes that allow an individual to select and focus on particular stimuli for further processing while simultaneously suppressing distracting information.</p>

  <p>If a group of high school students are given a set of colored words that are the same colors as the word, then students will on average say the words 30% faster when compared to a group that says words that arenâ€™t the same color.</p>

  <h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
  <p>Both <a href="#random-selection">Random Selection</a> and <a href="#random-assigment">Random Assignment</a> were used to ensure low experimental and participant bias. The participants were to generate a random number between 0 and 1 (online randomizer). The number 0 would place them in the control group
    while the number 1 would place them in the experimental group. However, the subject did not know which side of the coin corresponded with each test(<a href="#single-blind">Single Blind</a> procedure). The experimental group would receive the test with the mismatched colored words while the control group would receive the test with the correct matched colored
    words. The subjects were then told to read the color, not the word, and were timed on how long it took them to complete the test(timed in seconds). The number of mistakes they made was also counted. All of this data was then entered into a spreadsheet. None of the participant's personal data
  was recorded such as name, age, grade level, or race.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="independent-variable-definition">Independent Variable</h3>
    <p>The variable that is intentionally manipulated or changed by the researcher in an experiment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="dependent-variable-definition">Dependent Variable</h3>
    <p>The variable that is measured or observed in an experiment and is expected to change as a result of the independent variable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="population-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>Everyone who could possibly be a participant in the study.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="sample-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>A smaller set of data that a researcher chooses or selects from a larger population using a pre-defined selection method.</p>
  </div>

    <h3 id="random-selection">Random Selection</h3>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  div class="definition">
    <h3 id="random-assignment">Random Assignment</h3>
    <p>n indication that the results of a statistical analysis are unlikely to occur by chance. It suggests that the observed findings are likely to be a true effect rather than a result of random variation.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="experimental-group-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>The group of participants in an experiment who are exposed to the independent variable(can take the form of a treatment or intervention).</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="control-group-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>The group of participants in an experiment who do not receive the independent variable (can take the form of a treatment or intervention). They are used as a comparison group to assess the effects of the treatment.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="definition">
    <h3 id="p-value-definition">Population</h3>
    <p>A measure of the statistical significance of the results in a hypothesis test. It indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
