# Do You Really Know Your Colors?

## Hypothesis

Selective Attention - the processes that allow an individual to select and focus on particular stimuli for further processing while simultaneously suppressing distracting information

If a group of high school students are given a set of colored words that are the same colors as the word, then students will on average say the words 30% faster when compared to a group that says words that arenâ€™t the same color.
