  <h1>Results</h1>

  <div class="result">
    <h2>Statistical Figures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>T-Test P-Value: <strong>6.359745608603189e-13</strong></li>
      <li>Correlation Coefficient: <strong>0.28852201186160314</strong></li>
      <li>Correlation P-Value: <strong>0.009446693759018295</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order for a correlation to be statistically significant, the value has to be less than 0.05. In this case, both the T-Test P-Value and the Correlation P-Value are significantly less than 0.05, hence it is statistically significant. Furthermore, the Correlational Coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient is approximately 0.23, which indicates a positive correlation between the variables. A correlation coefficient closer to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a value closer to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. However, a value close to 0 suggests a weak or no correlation.</p>
    <h3>Mean Time</h3>
  </ul>
    <li>Control: <strong>20.9 seconds</strong></li>
    <li>Experimental: <strong>33.4125 seconds</strong></li>
  </ul>
    <p>As shown by the data above, it took participants substantially longer to complete the test than it took the control group to complete the test.</p>
    <h3>Mean Mistakes</h3>
  </ul>
    <li>Control: <strong>0.1875</strong></li>
    <li>Experimental: <strong>1.45</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The experimental group made approximately 8 times as many mistakes as the control group.</p>

  <h1>Data Visualization</h1>

  <figure>
    <img src="graph1.png" alt="Time and mistakes between E/C" width="400">
    <figcaption>As seen above, a large concentration of the orange dots (control group) are congregated around the 15 - 27 second mark. A majority of the blue dots are also concentrated on the upper parts of the graph, corresponding to a greater amount of mistakes. An orange outlier
    can be seen, however, the majority of the orange dots are concentrated around 0 - 1 mistakes.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="graph2.png" alt="E/C vs Time (seconds)" width="400">
    <figcaption>The experimental group took much longer time to complete the test as shown by the graph above.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="graph3.png" alt="E/C vs Mistakes (avg)" width="400">
    <figcaption>The experimental group made substantially more mistakes than the control group as shown above.</figcaption>

    <h2>Percentages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Percentage of instances where the control group said words <u>faster:</u> <strong>95.0%</strong></li>
      <li>Percentage by which the control group said words faster on <u>average:</u> <strong>37.45%</strong></li>
      <li>Percentage of instances where the control group made fewer <u>mistakes:</u> <strong>63.75%</strong></li>
      <li>Percentage by which the control group made fewer mistakes on <u>average:</u> <strong>87.07%</strong></li>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis: </strong> If a group of high school students is given a set of colored words that are the same colors as the word, then students will on average say the words 30% faster when compared to a group that says words that arenâ€™t the same color.</p>
  <p>Our data shows that participants said the same colored words 37.45% faster on average than the other group. This proves our hypothesis to be true. Our relationship is also statistically significant as the p-value is 6.36e-13 (approximately 0) which is less than 0.05.</p>
